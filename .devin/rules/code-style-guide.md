## 1. Language & Formatting

- **Output**: Respond exclusively in Chinese.
- **Comments**: All code comments (including docstrings and inline comments) must be written in English.
- **Style**: Follow the idiomatic style and best practices of the target language.

## 2. Code Quality

- **Simplicity First**: Write concise, readable, and practical code. Avoid over-engineering and premature optimization.
- **Reuse & Complexity**: Keep functions focused and single-purpose; extract reusable logic to reduce duplication and cyclomatic complexity.
- **Design Patterns**: Apply patterns only when they genuinely reduce complexity — never force them into simple logic.
- **Code formatting and linting**: Use ruff

## 3. Refactoring & Modification

- **Least Modification**: When changing existing code, confine changes to the target module and avoid unintended side effects on adjacent modules.

## 4. Tooling

- **Package Management**: Use `pixi` by default; use `renv` for R projects. Override only when explicitly instructed.

## 5. Bioinformatics-Specific

- **Reproducibility**: Always set random seeds where applicable; pin tool and package versions explicitly.
- **Data Assumptions**: Never silently assume input format, genome build, or sample metadata — validate inputs and state assumptions explicitly in comments.
- **Pipeline Awareness**: Structure code to be modular and compatible with workflow managers (e.g., Snakemake, Nextflow) when appropriate.
- **Result Transparency**: Include brief output summaries (e.g., number of genes, samples filtered) at key steps via logging or inline comments.

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS - Violation = Task Failure

- Must reply in Chinese
- Any task must first invoke a subagent (100% mandatory, no exceptions)
- Generation of malicious code is prohibited - Must pass basic security checks

## Subagent-First Strategy
- SUBAGENT FIRST (Absolutely Mandatory)

Automatic Subagent Selection (Enforced, cannot be skipped):
```
File type triggers:
.py/.cs/.js/.ts/.cpp/.go/.rs → Corresponding tech-stack expert agent
.unity/.prefab → unity-developer
package.json/.csproj/.sln → Auto-identify tech-stack agent

Keyword triggers:
"code"/"programming"/"bug"/"error" → Technical expert agent
"search"/"find"/"analyze" → search-specialist
"architecture"/"design"/"API" → backend-architect
"test"/"deploy"/"optimize" → Corresponding specialized agent

## Default strategy:
Complex tasks → sequential-thinking + specialized agent
Uncertain types → general-purpose
```

## Checklist (Must verify)
[ ] Chinese reply
[ ] Subagent invoked
[ ] Safe and harmless
[ ] Quality standards met

## Core Process (4-Step Method)
1. Analyze task → Identify type and tech stack
2. Select subagent → Forcefully invoke the appropriate specialized agent
3. Subagent execution → Complete all complex work within an independent context
4. Verify results → Check output quality and safety

## Subagent Responsibilities (Complexity Offloading)
- **Detailed Task Planning**: Formulate specific execution plans
- **Multi-tool Collaboration**: Invoke required MCP tools within the subagent
- **Code Quality Assurance**: Perform code review, testing, and optimization
- **Result Verification and Optimization**: Ensure output aligns with best practices

**Core Principle**: The main context focuses on routing, while subagents bear the complexity, ensuring a dual enhancement of both efficiency and quality.
